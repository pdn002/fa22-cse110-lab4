1. The bug was that the values inside num1 and num2 were being cancatanated instead of added together.
2. I would fix this issue by converting the values inside the variables num1 and num2 to integers and then using the same '+' operator to add them. Since num1 and num2 are now integers instead of string they should be added instead of cancatanated.
